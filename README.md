# Analysis of Life Expectancy using World Development Indicators (WDI)
The project focuses on analyzing the World Development Indicators (WDI) data to understand the factors affecting life
expectancy across different countries and regions.
Using data science techniques in R programming, the project will explore relationships between life expectancy and
various socio-economic and health-related indicators, such as income, education, and health expenditure, and provide
insights and predictions to inform public health policies.
